## Branching and Merging

Git allows for efficient management of branches and merging changes from different branches.

### Talks about :

1. git branch: List, create, or delete branches.
2. git checkout: Switch branches or restore working tree files.
3. git merge: Combine multiple sequences of commits into one unified history.
