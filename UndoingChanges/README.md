Undoing changes in Git is crucial for maintaining code integrity and managing mistakes. It allows developers to rectify errors, 
revert unwanted modifications, and experiment freely without risking the project's stability. With Git's undo functionalities, 
users can backtrack to previous states, undo erroneous commits, and refine code, ensuring a reliable and functional codebase 
while fostering a safe environment for development.
